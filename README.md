2) design and implement an SA algorithm

    a) baseline: counting sentiment words
    
    b) sentiment classification with NaiveBayes
    - features? implement your own idea(s) 

3) evaluate implementation
    -  10-fold cross validation (stratified) 
    - metric: accuracy
    - compare against
    
        a) gold standard
        
        b) baseline
        
        c) different iterations of your algorithm
